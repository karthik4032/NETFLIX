üîç Netflix EDA Case Study


In this project, I conducted a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a Netflix content dataset (8,800+ titles) using Python, pandas, seaborn, and Matplotlib. After performing detailed data cleaning, I normalized nested columns such as cast, country, and listed_in, handled missing values using contextual imputation strategies, and engineered new time-based features. I segmented the analysis across three dimensions: global trends, the U.S. market, and Indian content.
Key findings included:
- A global 70:30 split between Movies and TV Shows
- Peak additions in January, June, July, and December
- Most popular genres were International Movies, Dramas, and Comedies
- TV-MA was the most common rating, highlighting mature content preference
- India and the U.S. led in content volume, with strong seasonal patterns and cultural influences

Based on these insights, I proposed data-driven recommendations around content timing, genre investment, content duration sweet spots, and region-specific strategy enhancements. This project demonstrates my ability to ask the right business questions, communicate complex insights visually, and draw actionable conclusions‚Äîskills I aim to bring to my next role as a data analyst.
